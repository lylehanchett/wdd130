        <p> Hello, my name is Lyle Hanchett and I am from Gilbert, Arizona.  I have lived here for 19 years. I grew up in New Mexico but i moved here for a job
            just before i got married. I have been married to my wife Katy for almost 19 years and we have 3 wonderful daughters(monsters. LOL). I served a 
            mission in the Naga Philippines Mission. They announced  a temple being built there in 2022.  I work as a technician on Automated equipment in
        the food industry.  This means everyday i get to work on different equipment at a different facility. Its never a dull moment when equipment is broke down.
    I enjoy playing games with my girls. we have been playing chess a lot lately. I also have a group of friends that gets together to play Pathfinder.   </p>

        <p>Arizona is a beautiful and dangerous desert. There are many amazing sites in arizona that people travel from
            far and wide to see.
            There are many cities and Arizona has a population of about 8 million people. However there are many empty
            and wild areas full of
            Cactus, Scorpions, and Rattlesnakes.
